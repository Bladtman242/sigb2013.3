\section{Phong Illumination}
Illumination modeling is an important part of realistic rendering. It makes
colors look more realistic, and enhances the perception of perspective in the final
image.

The Phong illumination model aggregates three elements:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ambient lighting
\item Diffuse lighting
\item Specular lighting
\end{itemize}

We denote these so that $$I_{ambient} + I_{diffuse} + I_{specular} =
I_{phong}$$
