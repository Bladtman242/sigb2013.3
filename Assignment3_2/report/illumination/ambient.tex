\subsection{Ambient lighting}
Ambient lighting is the odd one out here. As a fixed-intensity, fixed-color
light that applies to all everything in the model, it corresponds to a
posotionless (or omni-present) light source. It has no real-world pendant, but
provides a basic intensity value for all objects. Its only variable is the
object material, denoted $K_{a}(x)$. The ambient light value for a point $x$ is
found by the formula $$I_{ambient}(x) = I_{a}K_{a}(x)$$ Where $I_{a}$
represents the 'light source' intensity, and $K_{a}(x)$ an intensity weight for
the object material at the poing $x$.
