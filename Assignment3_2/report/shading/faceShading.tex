\subsection{The ShadeFace method}

The assignment provides us with a lot of boilerplate code used in shading of
the cube faces. This section will attempt to clarify what is being done in the
provided code

The code is segregated in multiple sections separated by a comment line of dots.
The first section is declaration of variables. One important variable is the
shadeRes, which gives the resolution and therefore the dimensionality of the
shade. The next section projects the homogenious points from real world
coordinates to 2D coordinates. Next section defines a square that covers the
desired face (meaning from 0 to shadeRes in all dimension. Next section is
defines a homography from the texture to the projected points, meaning that
we can go from real world to 2D. In the next section three matrices for red,
green and blue channels respectively is set by our CalculateShadeMatrix
function. Next section applies the intensity values as a texture on top of the
image
