\subsection{Flat shading}

Flat shading is a computationally cheap way of achieving a shading effect of an
object in a 3D image. The theory behind is that each polygon gets the same
intensity value added to every pixel. Provided enough rasterization, it can
give a decent result, but the main advantage of flat shading compared to more
advanced methods like Phong and Gouraud shading is the smaller faster computations.
