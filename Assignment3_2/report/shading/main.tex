\section{Shading}

Shading is a way of giving the perception of depth in 3D illustrations.
This is achieved by depicting levels of darkness with respect to a given
light source. This section will attempt to describe to kinds of shading used
in computer graphics, flat and Phong shading. Each section will consist of a
short description of the overall theory behind the shading method followed by a
quick mention of our implementation.
